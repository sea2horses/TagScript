# TagScript

A joke programming language that answers that question everyone has about what would a programming language with HTML syntax would look like.

This is REALLY unfinished! And I decided to make it public just because it's probably one of my best efforts in making an Interpreter

Might finish this someday, but I actually want to place my efforts in making a useful programming language.

Documentation at: https://sea2horses.github.io/TagScript/

Although most features stated in the work docs, this language is unfinished, so beware.


# Usage

<code>dotnet run [file.tagx]</code>
